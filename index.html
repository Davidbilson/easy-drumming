    <p>It feels good watching a great drummer perform, and sometimes it feels like oh! Is it possible I play like this or is it possible I play in a great band. After a lot of practice I’ve been unable to meet some standards of coordination. The point is either you are a beginner or intermediate drummer, dedication to practice will increase your potential to be a great drummer, you wanna get better? Know that you have to be determined to work on yourself in these areas;</p>    

    <p><b style="font-size: 20px;">1.	Your state of mind</b><br><br>
        You have to know that for better experiences, always pay attention to details of how you feel, when bigger drummers play, some feel jealous, some envious, while some appreciate. So you check the state of your mind. When you appreciate other drummers, you begin to practice and play from a good inspiration, and not being boxed up with other feelings. I restricts!!!
    </p>   

    <p><b style="font-size: 20px;">2.	Know what you want</b><br><br>
        It is easy to say “  I want to become a great drummer” but do you make commitment towards making It a reality. Set a goal and plan for yourself and follow it daily. You can also make your tutor know your goals as he will help you through the paths.
    </p>   

    <p><b style="font-size: 20px;">3.	Effective practice and research</b><br><br>
        great treasures are placed where you have to seek after to improve you skills, don’t just practice but make more research to get the knowledge of how you can practice right, in other not to play dragging beats and rudiments, you play more effortless and natural when you do consistent practice with a good knowledge. Remember great drummers have invested their time in good and knowledgeable practice in the secret. Know that the moment you stop practicing, someone else is doing it, and it can lead to them moving fast ahead.
    </p>  

    <p><b style="font-size: 20px;">4.	Make right connections</b><br><br>
